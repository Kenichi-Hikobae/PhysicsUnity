Physics Unity 3D
----------------------------------
Unity project about the interaction of the physics implemented in Unity3D and other different features, such as the movement of objects, the interaction between them, plus a complete character controller with: basic movement, gravity, jumping, slope sliding, movement with object and ragdoll physics. Also in the project there are different features of a superhero programmed for the main character.
----------------------------------
In the physics of the scene have them the interaction between Rigibodies, the application of force to them and the reactions between their mass and their own characteristics. For the physical materials there is Bounce material, which simulates the bouncing of one object with another bouncing. There is a simulation of the main character's layer with an almost realistic configuration.

In the scene there are also different moving platforms, these were programmed to move at different set points based on their current position, also this can rotate on one axis. In addition to these platforms there is also a place where there is a platforming game where it disappears and reappears randomly.

Finally, the main character has a realistic configuration of how he would move and how he would be moved by objects in real life.It also features ragdoll physics that can be turned on and off and full third-person camera and movement settings. As for the superhero powers what the player can perform is, make a fist and push objects and jump higher than normal.

Controls
----------------------------------
W - A - S - D -> Movement
Space -> Jump
Hold Q -> Jump higher
Hold LeftClick -> Punch

----------------------------------
You can find different ways to deal with Unity3D physics and object movement as well as the movement of the main character and his camera in third person.
